## Google Scripts

- Upload this as a new script to https://script.google.com/home/
- Run it manually to make sure it works - I think that's when you'll be asked for permission to connect it to your inbox
- Verison it and deploy it https://developers.google.com/apps-script/concepts/deployments

## Database schema

- Each forwarded mail needs to be stored and assocated (or not) with an order on the system

```
ID
datetime email received at inbox
email subject
sender email
email body
order ID...
  -1 indicates parked aka marked as not assigned to an order but i don't want to delete it
  0 indicates awaiting order assignment / needs human intervention
  >0 indicates order ID this was assigned to
```

and a history table too

```
ID
email ID
datetime history entry
text of history entry (e.g. webhook received, order assigned)
user id...
  0 indicates the "system" did the action
  >0 indicates the userid of the user that did the action
```
